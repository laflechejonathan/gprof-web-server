This is a simple web service for rendering and visualizing call graphs as generated by the amazing [gprof2dot](gprof2dot on Github https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot).  I wanted to understand some gprof output recently and was annoyed that such a service didn't exist, so I made it.

See it in action here: [gprof.jlf-hacks.com](gprof.jlf-hacks.com)

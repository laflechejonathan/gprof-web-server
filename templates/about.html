## About Profiler Visualizer 2000

This is a simple web service for rendering and visualizing call graphs as generated by the amazing [gprof2dot](gprof2dot on Github https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot).  I wanted to understand some gprof output recently and was annoyed that such a service didn't exist, so I made it.  You can [check it out on github](https://github.com/laflechejonathan/gprof-web-server).

### FAQ

<br>
#### Q: What technologies are you using?

* Flask
* Bootstrap
* Viz.js
* SvgPan
* gprof2dot
* markdown

<br>
#### Q: Why is the site so slow?

Two reasons:

1. The service is hosted on a single, very basic EC2 instance.
2. I have made no effort to make it faster.

You should send me money or a pull request if you want it to be faster.

#### Q: Are you storing my profiling data or doing anything nefarious?

No - feel free to take a look at the code on Github.  Having said that, I still don't recommend uploading trade secrets or sensitive information to random websites.
